        <p>I am currently living in Berea, Ohio, and graduated from Notre Dame College in May 2018, located in South Euclid, Ohio. I earned my Bachelor of Arts Degree in Management Information Systems and have an interest in the field of Web Development and Cyber Security. Prior to College, I attended Trinity High School, where I was introduced to the technology field through their internship programs of: Information Technology, Graphic Design, Medical, and College Career readiness. I completed Trinity’s Information Technology Program which included the Hardware side of computers and obtained my CompTIA A+ Certification. In addition, three yearly internships: first at Trinity High School, second year at St. Bridget’s Elementary School in Parma, and third year at the Cleveland Museum of Art. In College, I was introduced to Web Development through my work study job with the Web Development Team where I started to get exposure to coding and the basics. After my Notre Dame College Web Development/Graphic Design Internship at the Kelvin Smith Library of Case Western University, I wanted to expand my knowledge in coding by attending the Case Western Coding Bootcamp where I will learn to become a better and more experienced coder and use these new skills to enhance my career choices.</p>
    
        <br>

        <p>Some of my hobbies include traveling, downhill snow skiing, coding, playing the Alto Saxophone, spending time with friends, and exercise. I enjoy watching sports and played Ice Hockey throughout my childhood until college. During High School and College, I was part of the marching band as well as concert band. During my freshman year of College, I was part of the Notre Dame College Indoor Winds Ensemble, a separate group representing the college who competed against other groups around Ohio to later make it to WGI World Championships in Dayton. <a href="https://wgi.org/"><strong><u>WGI</u></strong></a> is a traveling competition of indoor marching bands throughout the world, where one is judged for overall performance, music, uniqueness, and physical technique.</p>
